                <h1>The Pillory</h1><p> <span class="user">{{user}}</span> was definitely was not having the best day. He found himself locked in a pillory at the center of the town. He was bent over at an awkward angle and secured in place by two wooden boards restraining his head and hands. His hands were far enough away from his head that he couldn't even itch his nose.</p><p>The crime he was convicted of was written on a board posted above his head: "ᴘᴇᴛᴛʏ ᴛʜᴇꜰᴛ". He'd taken a loaf of bread from the bread maker at market day. Despite his insistences to the townsfolk that he genuinely thought he had paid for the bread, they still pelted him with rotten fruits and vegetables over the course of the day. After all, they knew his reputation.</p><p>"Rat" is a word that could be used to describe his nature just as well as his species. It seemed he would lie, cheat, steal, and fuck over just about anyone he could if it meant getting a leg up in life. A pattern of such behavior had come back to haunt him in some minor but unpleasant ways before, but this had never been enough to actually deter him from his lifestyle. As far as he was concerned, his current predicament was just another tax for doing "business" the way he wanted to.</p><p>The sun had set hours ago, and it would seem most of the townsfolk had gone to bed. <span class="user">{{user}}</span> had been trying to do so himself for quite some time now, but the awkward position he was placed in made it nigh impossible. No matter how he'd position himself, some part of him was always receiving too much pressure to be comfortable, whether it was his neck, his wrists, or his feet. He strongly suspected that sleep may be entirely impossible.</p><p>As he adjusted his position for what must've been the thousandth time that day, he heard footsteps coming from behind him. Immediately, the man's back stiffened in dread. Not only was someone else up this late, but they were behind him—and completely out of his range of sight.</p><p>As he listened and determined that the footsteps were definitely coming closer, he grew defensive. "Oi! Who's that?" he shouted. "What the hell're you doin' out so late?"</p><p>Only adding to his levels of stress, the person did not reply.</p><p>"Oi!" he shouted much more loudly. "I'm talkin' ta you! The fuck're ya doin' here?"</p><p>Again, they did not respond. The tension only built and built as he anxiously listened to the footsteps. Then, before long, the person was right up on him. He braced himself for whatever sort of assault could be coming to his rear end, but nothing of the sort ever came. In fact, the person didn't even slow down as they reached him. They just walked around him and the pillory to the front.</p><p>It was dark out and the only light provided to <span class="user">{{user}}</span> was coming from the moon, but the man knew well enough that he was looking at another furred. The ear-shaped bumps on the hood of their cloak and their tail made that obvious enough. Still, he couldn't yet recognize the person.</p><p>"Who are you?" he asked, trying to make out all the details he could in the limited lighting.</p><p>Finally, the person pulled down their hood. "Hello, <span class="user">{{user}}</span>."</p><p>He recognized the woman. She was a skunk who lived on the other side of the village. Her name was <span class="char">{{char}}</span>, and the two of them had some indirect, although still quite serious, history.</p><p><span class="user">{{user}}</span> had gotten <span class="char">{{char}}</span>'s father arrested, tried, and sent off to prison, where he remained today. A few years back, the town—as well as the country as a hole—was going through a crisis. Their crop yields were far below targets due to a combination of bad weather and war with a neighboring nation. As such, there simply was not enough food to go around. Countless people around the country went hungry, and many others died. <span class="user">{{user}}</span> and <span class="char">{{char}}</span>'s town had been fortunate enough not to suffer any deaths, but there were a number of close calls.</p><p>It was a rough time, and many did whatever they could to find food. In the case of <span class="char">{{char}}</span>'s father, he had travelled in secret to a nearby village just past the border of the same country they'd been at war with and smuggled back food he'd bought in exchange for own valuables, then distributed that food among the townsfolk. He had to do so in secret; if anyone in the government found out he'd been trading with an enemy country, he'd be locked up for years, if not hanged outright.</p><p>He was eventually caught. Someone had privately alerted the police to the food smuggling operation—collecting a modest cash reward in the process—and after being caught in the act, her father was taken away to stand trial and eventually be sent to prison. Though the police never disclosed who had informed them, it was said that more than one of them had let the name slip on numerous occasions while drinking at the pub, and the informant was <span class="user">{{user}}</span> the rat. He was the one who'd shut down access to a more robust supply of food, he was the cause of many people going hungry, and he was the reason <span class="char">{{char}}</span>'s beloved father was in prison.</p><p>"<span class="char">{{char}}</span>!" he said, his defensive terror quickly giving away to gregarious affability. "My girl, you can't sneak up on a man like that, especially not one in as vulnerable a position as I am!" He chuckled.</p><p>She stayed still and silent.</p><p>Her refusal to speak unsettled him slightly, but it wasn't enough to keep him from trying to make friendly conversation despite his situation.</p><p>He gestured up at the sign above his head. "Can ya believe it?" he said, smirking. "Theft! As if I'd ever do anythin' like that. It was an honest mistake, but they just weren't having that."</p><p>Again, she was silent. She just looked down at him.</p><p><span class="user">{{user}}</span> exhaled. "Man, am I glad to see you, though! I'm bloody starved if I'm to be honest. Do ya think you could do a massive favor for me? If you could get me some bread and a cup of water, maybe some of that fancy cheese they sell at the shops, I'll certainly repay ya for all your generosity as soon as I get out of 'ere!"</p><p>Of course, he had no real intention of ever paying the girl back or compensating her for her time. He just wanted something to eat, and if getting that called for deceiving her, so be it. "Just name your price, and we’ll—"</p><p>The skunk's tail began to rise.</p><p>"Hey," <span class="user">{{user}}</span> said, immediately noticing the movement. "What are ya doin'? I'm not stressin' you out, am I?"</p><p>It kept rising. It moved so slowly, like a cock gradually growing tumescent.</p><p>"Stop it," <span class="user">{{user}}</span> said, starting to get visibly stressed and uncomfortable. "Please. The rotten food was enough humiliation and punishment already. I mean, we're friends, aren't we?"</p><p>"We were never friends," the skunk said bitterly.</p><p>"Look, I'm sorry, <span class="char">{{char}}</span>," he begged hurriedly. "Whatever I did to make you wanna do this, I swear it's—"</p><p>"'Whatever you did'?" <span class="char">{{char}}</span> repeated back. "What you did was sell out my father just to make a quick buck!"</p><p>He played dumb. "Wha-what?"</p><p>"My father was risking his freedom and his life to feed the people of the town, and yet you sold him out to collect the reward!"</p><p>"<span class="char">{{char}}</span>, I'm not the reason your dad's locked up."</p><p>"Don't you try and tell me someone else did it!" she snapped at him, her tail bristling in anger. "Everyone knows! Everyone knows you're the one who gave his name to the chief!"</p><p>"It's not that," he said, trying to look calm despite the implicit threat her tail raised. "I can't lie to you… I was the one who turned him in, but it's not my fault. It's your father's…"</p><p>"<em>What?</em>"</p><p>"He was the one committing the crime, <span class="char">{{char}}</span>. If he just hadn't done that, he—"</p><p>The rat's words were cut off by a deluge of hot, stinging musk landing on his face. His coherent, smooth-talking words gave way to a graceless scream of distress and ragged breathing. He coughed and sputtered, the awfulness of the fluid wasting no time before (metaphorically) knocking him off his feet.</p><p>The stuff stunk worse than anything <span class="user">{{user}}</span> had ever smelled or could have imagined. It was worse than manure, worse than the overflowing sewers, worse than anything. It was as if a rubber-processing plant had been set ablaze while hosting a luncheon in which the only foods served were whole heads of garlic and petroleum.</p><p>The rat wanted nothing more than to pinch his nose and run away, but unfortunately neither was possible in his current predicament. Nonetheless, that did not stop him from trying harder than he had all day to pull himself free of the pillory's grasp. Alas, it didn't budge, and he was forced to remain there, bent over at an awkward angle with tears leaking from his eyes and snot running from his nose.</p><p>He squirmed for a while longer, spitting, swearing, and eventually gagging as <span class="char">{{char}}</span> stood and watched. She had taken a few steps back to avoid breathing in the absolute worst of it, but even with that small advantage her resistance to her own utterly repulsive stench was remarkable.</p><p>Of course, <span class="user">{{user}}</span> had no idea where she was. For all he knew, she could have run away the second after she sprayed him. On top of causing all the other fun symptoms already described, a direct shot to the face can leave the victim momentarily blind as well as utterly disoriented. Though <span class="user">{{user}}</span> knew intellectually that he was in a pillory, that did not stop him from desperately trying to scratch at his eyes to rid them of the vile fluid, only to grow confused and distressed when he found he was unable to reach his face with his hands. This just caused him to pull harder and cause himself injuries that would doubtless turn into quite ugly bruises later on.</p><p>After he gained back some amount of his strength and mental awareness, he immediately began using it to hurl verbal abuse at the skunk who had done this to him. After spitting one more time, he shouted, "You bitch! You disgusting, fucking bitch!"</p><p><span class="char">{{char}}</span> responded to his abuse with some of her own, this time of the physical variety. She kneed him in the chin quite hard.</p><p>"You fucker!" he screamed after recovering slightly from that assault. "I'll fuckin' stab you, bitch! Leave me the fuck alone!"</p><p>"Not yet," she said, walking around the pillory until he could no longer see her.</p><p>"What're you doing?" he demanded. "You filthy cunt, what're you doing back there?"</p><p>He felt her run her claws along his finely tailored waistcoat. "Quite the fancy vest you have on…" she said. "Did you buy it with the money you made from selling out my father?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>He felt as if someone was pulling on his waistcoat, and then he heard the fabric loudly rip. The skunk had dug her claws into it and ripped three lines clear through.</p><p>"You fucking bitch!" he shouted, angrily yanking his body away from her as best he could given his restraints. "Do you know how much this fucking costs? More than your fucking life!"</p><p>"Guess it's a shame you'll never be wearing it again, then."</p><p>Before he could bark any further obscenities at her, <span class="char">{{char}}</span> lifted her tail and drenched the man's entire back in her fetid musk. The disgustingly warm fluid seeped into his clothes, leaving little doubt that the white dress shirt below the waistcoat would be stained yellow.</p><p>"You repulsive vermin, you worthless cunt!" he shouted, furious beyond words that he was given no chance to retaliate against her. Even after he was freed, he doubted any attempt at getting his revenge would result in him being far worse off—a fact only compounded by the fact that she had a good foot and at least thirty pounds on him.</p><p>She walked to the other side of him, then repeated her previous assault. Now, his body had been sprayed from both sides, ensuring that not a moment would go for at least the next week that he didn't smell her awful, awful stench.</p><p>Unfortunately for the rat, hurling insults at her was not an option by this point. The cloud of sheer, concentrated stink hung so heavily around him that it was a struggle now just to breathe. He coughed and wheezed, fighting to secure even a lungful of somewhat breathable air. He found none.</p><p>As he fought simply to breathe while also dealing with odor-induced nausea so intense that he had to gag between breaths, <span class="char">{{char}}</span> walked around the pillory to once again stand in front of him.</p><p>He knew what was coming: a verbal assault to equal or exceed his own colorful parade of insults. She would lecture him on the importance of never messing with her or her family again, and every word would go in one ear and out the other. Not only was he preoccupied with getting oxygen in his lungs, but he held little respect for whatever the sick sadist had to say to him.</p><p>Or at least, he <em>thought</em> he knew what was coming. Instead of launching into a tirade, however, the skunk turned away from him one more time and raised her tail. In an instant, his attention was ripped away from the struggle to survive and diverted to the weapon that loomed right in front of his snout. He felt like he was looking down the barrel of a cannon, and he was listening to its fuse sizzle.</p><p>He could do nothing but watch as two red-pink nubs extended from her asshole and dispensed two sickly yellow streams of musk. To his surprise, their aim did not seem centered on his face. Instead, she was aiming just above it.</p><p>The hot, wet gunk landed on his forehead. A few stray drops landed in his eyes (and caused him <em>immense</em> pain and discomfort), but most of it landed on the hair atop his head. The mane of hair he valued so highly was instantly wetted and depressed against his scalp by the thick skunk oils.</p><p>Instinctually, he tried to whip his head side to side to fling off as much of the fluid as he could before it really sank in and did some lasting damage. But with his neck locked in place, all he could do was rotate it as fast as he could. This proved to be much less effective and, as it turned out, would be proven futile in just a matter of seconds.</p><p>Barely giving him a chance to make some sort of recovery from that brutal attack on his pride, <span class="char">{{char}}</span> backed up until her ass cheeks practically hugged his face. Then, she performed a short hop up so that she was now half-standing, half-sitting on top of the rat's head.</p><p><em>Hssss!</em></p><p>He actually got to listen as the skunk released her noxious juices directly onto the top of his head. She sprayed so much, in fact, that he felt the slimy fluid run off the top of his head and then drip down the side. She hurriedly hopped off and took a step back to survey the damage she'd done.</p><p>He felt drop after thick drop of the utterly repulsive liquid run through his sideburns, down to his chin and then at last land on the cobblestone street just below his head to form a small pool. This would be just about all he would stare at for the next four or five hours before someone finally came to release him from his punishment.</p><p>He certainly wasn't far off from puking at this point. "You nasty, nasty bitch," he said, gagging on the wretched fumes.</p><p>She turned around from him and raised her tail. "Keep talking."</p><p>"No!" he shouted, immediately realizing his mistake. "I'm sorry… Please, no more."</p><p>She kept her tail raised for a few more seconds, then slowly let it fall back down again. Then, she pulled her hood back over her head again and walked off the way she came.</p><p>The next several hours were hell for the rat. He knew his body wanted him to throw up, but as much as he wanted to get it over with, he simply couldn't produce more than a couple globs of bile. As a result, he had the misfortune of spending the next four hours teetering back and forth on the edge of vomiting. It was torture.</p><p>Finally, as the sun was just starting to rise, a couple of the sheriff's men came to release him from his punishment. But when they approached him, they found themselves unable to get within more than a dozen meters of <span class="user">{{user}}</span>. For the longest time, the two furreds stood on the edge of the town square, attempting to acclimate themselves to the fearsome stench so they could move in close enough to unlock the pillory. Thankfully for them, however, a human patrolman eventually happened by and they roped him in to help.</p><p>Even after <span class="user">{{user}}</span> was free, his torture was not over. He hurriedly made his way to his home, the still-damp clothes rubbing uncomfortably against his fur all the way, and immediately stripped before running himself a bath. To his surprise, the smell seemed to only mutate into a whole new sort of disgusting as soon as the musk touched the water. He again spat up some bile a few times as he attempted to make himself clean.</p><p>He smelled no better by the time he got out of the bathtub almost an hour later. Worse yet, he found his entire bedroom smelled absolutely horrendous. The musk-soaked clothes he'd removed had filled the entire room with their noxious fumes as they lay on the floor. The stench lingered even after he tossed his clothes out the window and onto the street. It seemed like the odors had somehow seeped into the fabric and wood of his furniture just by virtue of being in the same room as the offensive stuff. It certainly felt as if he were doomed to carry this unyielding stink with him for the rest of his life.</p>
